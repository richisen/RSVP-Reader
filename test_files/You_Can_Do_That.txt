New Student Convocation
Georgia Institute of Technology

And so, in the words of Sir Isaac Newton: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

Georgia Tech is proud of its many traditions, but the one I find most exciting is ...

Our tradition of excellence!

Our mission as students is not to follow in the footsteps of the astronauts, Nobel Prize Laureates, and president who graduated before us, but to exceed their footsteps,

Crush the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand!

We here are all such innovative people.

So I am telling you

if you want to change the world, you’re at Georgia Tech, you can do that!

If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you’re at Georgia Tech–you can do that!

If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we’re at Georgia Tech–we can do that!

I am doing that!

Congratulations on your acceptance and brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer.
